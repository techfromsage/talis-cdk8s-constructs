  /**
   * Listeners associated with this Gateway. Listeners define

   * At least one Listener MUST be specified.
   *
   *
   * Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)
   * MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to
   * exactly one listener. (This section uses "set of Listeners" rather than
   * "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration
   * from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
   * apply in that case).
   *
   *
   * Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
   * combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.
   *
   *
   * Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
   * Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on their
   * targeted conformance profile:
   *
   *
   * HTTP Profile
   *
   *
   * 1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
   * 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided
   *
   *
   * TLS Profile
   *
   *
   * 1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough
   *
   *
   * "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:
   *
   *
   * The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
   * Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
   * example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
   * can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
   * Listener fields.
   *
   *
   * For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:
   *
   *
   * 1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the "HTTP"
   * Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
   * 2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the "HTTPS" or
   * "TLS" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
   * 3. A mixture of "TCP" and "UDP" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener
   * with the same Protocol has the same Port value.
   *
   *
   * Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect
   * whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant
   * for HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
   *
   *
   * When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol
   * Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the
   * Listener to be distinct.
   *
   *
   * When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request
   * hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
   * values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
   *
   *
   * Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
   * matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
   * matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
   * `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
   *
   *
   * Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
   * wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
   * For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
   * The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
   * hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
   *
   *
   * The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
   * the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
   * `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
   *
   *
   * If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
   * Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
   * condition in the Listener Status to "True".
   *
   *
   * Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
   * Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
   * no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may
   * accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting
   * Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.
   * This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting
   * Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at
   * least one Listener must be present.
   *
   *
   * The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
   * Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
   * not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
   * indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
   * Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
   * indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.
   *
   *
   * A Gateway's Listeners are considered "compatible" if:
   *
   *
   * 1. They are distinct.
   * 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
   * requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
   * addresses.
   *
   *
   * Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
   * implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
   * may not be compatible for another.
   *
   *
   * For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
   * on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
   * would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
   *
   *
   * Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if
   * Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
   * request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
   * to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
   * This concept is known as "Listener Isolation". Implementations that do
   * not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.
   *
   *
   * Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
   * Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

  /**
   * Listeners associated with this Gateway. Listeners define

   * At least one Listener MUST be specified.
   *
   *
   * Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)
   * MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to
   * exactly one listener. (This section uses "set of Listeners" rather than
   * "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration
   * from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
   * apply in that case).
   *
   *
   * Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
   * combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.
   *
   *
   * Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
   * Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on their
   * targeted conformance profile:
   *
   *
   * HTTP Profile
   *
   *
   * 1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
   * 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided
   *
   *
   * TLS Profile
   *
   *
   * 1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough
   *
   *
   * "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:
   *
   *
   * The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
   * Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
   * example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
   * can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
   * Listener fields.
   *
   *
   * For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:
   *
   *
   * 1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the "HTTP"
   * Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
   * 2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the "HTTPS" or
   * "TLS" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
   * 3. A mixture of "TCP" and "UDP" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener
   * with the same Protocol has the same Port value.
   *
   *
   * Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect
   * whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant
   * for HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
   *
   *
   * When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol
   * Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the
   * Listener to be distinct.
   *
   *
   * When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request
   * hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
   * values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
   *
   *
   * Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
   * matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
   * matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
   * `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
   *
   *
   * Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
   * wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
   * For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
   * The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
   * hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
   *
   *
   * The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
   * the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
   * `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
   *
   *
   * If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
   * Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
   * condition in the Listener Status to "True".
   *
   *
   * Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
   * Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
   * no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may
   * accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting
   * Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.
   * This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting
   * Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at
   * least one Listener must be present.
   *
   *
   * The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
   * Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
   * not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
   * indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
   * Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
   * indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.
   *
   *
   * A Gateway's Listeners are considered "compatible" if:
   *
   *
   * 1. They are distinct.
   * 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
   * requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
   * addresses.
   *
   *
   * Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
   * implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
   * may not be compatible for another.
   *
   *
   * For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
   * on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
   * would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
   *
   *
   * Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if
   * Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
   * request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
   * to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
   * This concept is known as "Listener Isolation". Implementations that do
   * not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.
   *
   *
   * Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
   * Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

   * the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
   * namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
   * namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
   * and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
   * not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
   * create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
   * Route.
   *
   *
   * There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
   *
   *
   * * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
   * * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
   *
   *
   * This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
   * resources.
   *
   *
   * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
   *
   *
   * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
   * entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
   * multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
   * be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
   * * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
   * each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
   * optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
   * combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
   *
   *
   * Some examples:
   *
   *
   * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
   * same object must also set `sectionName`.
   * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
   * object must also set `port`.
   * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
   * referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.

   * label MUST appear by itself as the first label.
   *
   *
   * If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and GRPCRoute, there
   * MUST be at least one intersecting hostname for the GRPCRoute to be
   * attached to the Listener. For example:
   *
   *
   * * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches GRPCRoutes
   * that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
   * least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
   * * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches GRPCRoutes
   * that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
   * one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
   * `test.example.com` and `*.example.com` would both match. On the other
   * hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match.
   *
   *
   * Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
   * as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
   * both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.
   *
   *
   * If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, any
   * GRPCRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
   * ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
   * GRPCRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
   * `test.example.net` MUST NOT be considered for a match.
   *
   *
   * If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, and none
   * match with the criteria above, then the GRPCRoute MUST NOT be accepted by
   * the implementation. The implementation MUST raise an 'Accepted' Condition
   * with a status of `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.
   *
   *
   * If a Route (A) of type HTTPRoute or GRPCRoute is attached to a
   * Listener and that listener already has another Route (B) of the other

  /**
   * ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
   * to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
   * allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
   * the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
   * namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
   * namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
   * and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
   * not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
   * create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
   * Route.
   *
   *
   * There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
   *
   *
   * * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
   * * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
   *
   *
   * This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
   * resources.
   *
   *
   * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
   *
   *
   * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
   * entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
   * multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
   * be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
   * * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
   * each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
   * optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
   * combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
   *
   *
   * Some examples:
   *
   *
   * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
   * same object must also set `sectionName`.
   * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
   * object must also set `port`.
   * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
   * referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
   *
   *
   * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
   * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
   * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
   * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
   * merged.
   *
   *
   * Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
   * rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
   * allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
   * Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a

   * 1. IPs are not allowed.
   * 2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
   * label must appear by itself as the first label.
   *
   *
   * If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there
   * must be at least one intersecting hostname for the HTTPRoute to be

   *
   *
   * * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes

   * one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
   * `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com` would
   * all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would
   * not match.
   *
   *
   * Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
   * as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
   * both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.
   *
   *
   * If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any
   * HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
   * ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
   * HTTPRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
   * `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match.
   *
   *
   * If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, and none
   * match with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The
   * implementation must raise an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of
   * `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.
   *
   *
   * In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify intersecting hostnames (e.g.
   * overlapping wildcard matching and exact matching hostnames), precedence must
   * be given to rules from the HTTPRoute with the largest number of:
   *
   *
   * * Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname.

   * ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants

   * allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
   * the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
   * namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
   * namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
   * and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
   * not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
   * create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
   * Route.
   *
   *
   * There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
   *
   *
   * * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
   * * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
   *
   *
   * This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
   * resources.
   *
   *
   * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
   *
   *
   * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
   * entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
   * multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
   * be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
   * * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
   * each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
   * optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
   * combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
   *
   *
   * Some examples:
   *
   *
   * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
   * same object must also set `sectionName`.
   * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
   * object must also set `port`.
   * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
   * referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
   *
   *
   * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
   * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
   * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the

   * allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,

   * configuration) MUST forward this header unmodified to the backend.
   *

   * Valid values for Hostnames are determined by RFC 1123 definition of a

   *
   *
   * 1. IPs are not allowed.
   * 2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
   * label must appear by itself as the first label.
   *
   *
   * If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there
   * must be at least one intersecting hostname for the HTTPRoute to be
   * attached to the Listener. For example:
   *
   *
   * * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
   * that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
   * least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
   * * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
   * that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
   * one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
   * `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com` would
   * all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would
   * not match.
   *
   *
   * Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
   * as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
   * both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.
   *
   *
   * If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any
   * HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
   * ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
   * HTTPRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
   * `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match.
   *
   *
   * If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, and none
   * match with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The
   * implementation must raise an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of
   * `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.
   *
   *
   * In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify intersecting hostnames (e.g.
   * overlapping wildcard matching and exact matching hostnames), precedence must
   * be given to rules from the HTTPRoute with the largest number of:
   *
   *
   * * Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname.

   * ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants

   * allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
   * the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
   * namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
   * namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
   * and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
   * not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
   * create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
   * Route.
   *
   *
   * There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
   *
   *
   * * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
   * * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
   *
   *
   * This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
   * resources.
   *
   *
   * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
   *
   *
   * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
   * entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
   * multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
   * be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
   * * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
   * each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
   * optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
   * combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
   *
   *
   * Some examples:
   *
   *
   * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
   * same object must also set `sectionName`.
   * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
   * object must also set `port`.
   * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
   * referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
   *
   *
   * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
   * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
   * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
   * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
   * merged.
   *
   *
   * Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
   * rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
   * allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
   * Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
